===================================== Practice ============================================

1. RUN THE FEATURE FILE WITHOUT DRY-RUN OPTION

    You are in the Samsung Page

    SmartTV Curvo 55

    You can implement step definitions for undefined steps with these snippets:

    And(/^the price are: <price>$/) do
      pending # Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
    end

    Skipped step

    You are in the Samsung Page

    SmartTV 3D


    You can implement step definitions for undefined steps with these snippets:

    And(/^the price are: <price>$/) do
      pending # Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
    end

    Skipped step
    2 scenarios (2 undefined)
    8 steps (2 skipped, 2 undefined, 4 passed)
    0m0.057s

2. RUN THE FEATURE FILE USING DRY-RUN OPTION

   Feature: Samsung TV models homepage
     As a user of the Samsung website
     I want to have a website for every Samsung TV model
     So that I can get all the information about my favorite model

     Scenario Outline: TV models page        # features/models_tv.feature:6
       Given I am on the Samsung page        # features/models_tv.feature:7
       When the models pages are: <models>   # features/models_tv.feature:8
       And the price are: <price>            # features/models_tv.feature:9
       Then I should get the Smart TV models # features/models_tv.feature:10

       Examples:
         | models           |
         | SmartTV Curvo 55 |  You are in the Samsung Page, SmartTV Curvo 55
         | SmartTV 3D       |  You are in the Samsung Page, SmartTV 3D

   2 scenarios (2 undefined)
   8 steps (2 skipped, 2 undefined, 4 passed)
   0m0.142s

   You can implement step definitions for undefined steps with these snippets:

   When(/^the price are: <price>$/) do
     pending # Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
   end

3. WHICH ONE IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BOTH EXECUTIONS?

    The differences are:

    When executing the command --dry-run does not execute the feature but rather it checks the steps that are not
    defined and asks that the action with the step is made concrete.

    When executing the feature file, the scenario is executed but at the moment of finding a step that has not defined
    its step the other steps are marked as skipped not being executed.
